        <h2>Building a Better Future</h2>
        <p>
            The robots are coming! The robots are coming!
        </p>
        <p>
            Paul Revere, meet the Terminator. That is at least one problematic possibility. But whether we like it or not, the future is coming, and that future will include increasingly intelligent and capable automation.
            It's not unlikely that we will see AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, in our lifetimes.
            But what does that future look like? 
            Will these AGI be hunter-destroyer machines like the Terminator movies?
            Or is it possible that we might have the foresight to design these minds in such a way that we can live in synergistic harmony together?
            Is it possible that this technology could be harnessed to provide humanity, even the bottom 1% of humanity, with a life of hyper-abundance? 
            Sounds like a utopian pipe dream? Maybe.
            But if enough of us work together towards this vision, it is within the realm of possibility, even if it may not be the most probable future based on the worlds' powers' current philosophies and momentum.

            The structure of the Technocratic Party is based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
            Essentially rejecting pre-existing political philosophies and starting again from first principles with the whole set of 21st century tools and technologies at our disposal. 
            It aims to balance the philosophies of capitalism and socialism with the premise that governments (or in this case, the Technocratic Party) should provide for peoples' needs, but not their wants.
            Hence basing the organizational foundation on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, from the bottom up.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            At the most foundational level people need:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Shelter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once these fundamental needs are met we move up one Maslow level and people need:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Physical Security</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Solving the technological propblems for these six sets of needs and deploying the solutions is the primary goal of the Technocratic Party.
            The Technocratic Party rejects incomplete solutions such as universal basic income and food stamps in preference of solutions that solve these problems in the real material world.
            Food stamps don't fix anything if the soil is so poisoned that food won't grow. Food stamps is an incomplete solution that cannot even account for such things.
            Economically viable vertical farms built in city centers, run by robots, distributing free nutritionally balanced vegitarian meals on the ground floor is a fundamentally superior solution, if we can just solve the engineering problems involved.
